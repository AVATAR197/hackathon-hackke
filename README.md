## Technology we used

-   React
-   express.js
-   MySQL database
-   google cloud services

## WHAT THE APP DOES

Patient with diabetes is able to add his glucose level and insulin to the app and keep track of that. The other part of the app is the doctor dashboard where his doctor can see the data in real-time. Nowadays patients wrote the data on the paper and they brought them to the ambulance when they had an appointment. This is not a problem anymore.

## THE PROBLEMS WE FACED

We faced many problems (like connecting to the created database) because no one really knew that. We are using google cloud services which are really complex. But eventually, we finished everything on time and you can see our app on the link [hackke.herokuapp.com](http://hackke.herokuapp.com/).

### CURRENTLY the backend can be accessed only through localhost...

I hope you will understand that. We spent enormous time setting up the google cloud platform SQL database. We had to use the proxy and stuff. But still, you can see the website, you just wouldn't be able to use the database. The design is still fine.
